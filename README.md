7. To get your API key, go to the website and click on "Player Journal Log" then click on EDMC Plug-in tab to see your API key.  Or you can just click on the EDSCC credentials link in the EDMC settings and you will be automatically redirected to the ED:SCC website and be presented with the API key (you will need to log in first if you haven't already).
8. Next, you will need to enter your API server endpoint URL.  Depending on which server you are on, usually in this format: https://{server name}/api/edmc.  You can view the URL in the Player Journal Log page as well.
9. Go back to EDMC and enter it in the settings.
10. Start up Elite Dangerous and start flying!
11. If you see authentication denied message on the bottom of EDMC window, quit back to the main menu and restart your game.  This will fix the authentication errors.
12. If EDSCC Post Status at the bottom says Success, then the data has been successfully sent to the EDSCC!
